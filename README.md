# Shop-smart
Modern grocery shopping companion app.  Make grocery shopping easier, simpler, and more budget-friendly via the use of unique customizations and planning through the Shop-Smart app.

Shop-smart was created in order to simplify the process of grocery-list making. Far too often, you forget to add something to the list, or wind up buying something you already have at home. This app solves both of these via two unique features:

1) Meals. As opposed to jotting down all the ingredients you'll need for the week, simply plan out what your meals for the week! Users are able to create their own meals (4 are provided as an example on start), and instantly populate the current list with all the ingredients with said meal.  If a particular ingredient in a meal is already listed on the current list, Shop-Smart knows to not duplicate this item.
2) Pantry.  Users are able to enter and update what they already have at home within the 'pantry' page. If the user adds an item to the list that is present in the user's pantry, the pantry emoji will appear next to this item; the user can simply remove this item from the list if he or she so chooses.
